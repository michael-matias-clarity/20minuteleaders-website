			<title><![CDATA[Ep1171: Fernando Dominguez Pinuaga: Quantum Meets AI]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Fernando Dominguez Pinuaga shares his journey from energy systems to Google X, where he learned to think in true moonshot scale before joining SandboxAQ. At the crossroads of AI and quantum physics, he leads initiatives that are redefining cybersecurity and scientific computing.He explains how adversaries are already stealing encrypted information today through <em>store-now, decrypt-later</em> attacks — making quantum-era risk a current problem, not a future one. Fernando outlines the path toward crypto-agility, encryption inventorying, and modernization strategies that governments, banks, and enterprises must now adopt.Beyond security, he highlights the rise of physics-based AI models capable of accelerating breakthroughs in drug discovery, materials science, energy systems, and financial modeling — areas where classical AI struggles. Fernando frames this moment as the beginning of a new computational era, where quantum principles and AI jointly shape the next industrial wave.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ep1169: Lauren Freund: Engagement Over Reach]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Lauren Freund has spent the last few years inside her dream company, leading social media and influencer marketing at Canva. She describes why traditional influencer playbooks—optimizing for follower counts and reach—are increasingly outdated, and why she now screens creators for deep engagement, relevance, and the ability to truly carry Canva’s message. For her, the messenger is as important as the message, and influencer feedback is anchored in objectives and CTAs, not rewriting their voice. On the brand side, she runs every idea through a simple but demanding filter: <em>why share and why care</em>—why the company should post it, and why the audience would genuinely care. From there, she uses each platform’s “success signals,” like shares/saves or time-on-post, to decide when to use video and when carousels outperform. Lauren closes by reflecting on working at a product she genuinely loves and how the ever-changing worlds of social and AI keep the work exciting and experimental.#20MinuteLeaders #SocialMediaStrategy #InfluencerMarketing #CreatorEconomy</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ep1168: Anya Law: Actionable Social Listening]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Coming from years of manual social monitoring in marketing roles, Anya Law saw how expensive and ineffective traditional social listening was for startups. Meeting her co-founder at Atlanta Tech Village, she joined PitchGhost to transform a simple Twitter scraper into a full prompt-based, actionable social listening platform. The team discovered their ICP through trial and error—moving from solo founders to multi-person GTM teams who needed context-aware posts, sentiment filters, and response automation. With LinkedIn support as a major differentiator, PitchGhost is now expanding integrations, APIs, and CRM workflows to become a core part of the modern RevOps stack. Anya’s story is one of solving her own pain, refining personas, and building a tool that helps teams act—not just monitor. </p><p>#SocialListening #GTMStrategy #MarketingAutomation</p><p><br></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Growing up in Wisconsin’s drinking culture, Daniel Adix launched LiQure to help people “feel good the next day.” After discovering DHM and developing a gummy-based recovery supplement, he navigated taste issues, manufacturing resets, FDA compliance, and the realities of CPG distribution. Rather than chasing ads, he built LiQure through festivals, bars, and targeted retail—landing Foxtrot Chicago as an early anchor. Daniel frames LiQure not as a party hack but as a performance-enhancing recovery brand that supports real-world consumers and modern wellness routines.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ep1166 | Matan Kadim: Identity Drives Fitness]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Matan Kadim’s path into fitness began with a personal struggle and grew into a career of coaching and international learning. He argues that real change comes not from short-term resolutions but from identity-level shifts: <em>who you see yourself as</em>. Training, he explains, is not just against comfort zones but against evolutionary programming for ease and safety. By reframing workouts as daily battles with comfort, Matan helps clients develop resilience, discipline, and joy in the process. His “simple but not easy” philosophy cuts through misinformation and fad culture, emphasizing consistency, sleep, nutrition, and growth mindset. For Matan, the gym is a microcosm of life—identity, habits, and resilience all align to shape who you become.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Neta Bresler’s journey began with a childhood magic kit and evolved into a 1,500-student academy and global recognition as a top mentalist. Today, he reframes mentalism as “mind art”—a discipline that maps human blind spots and leverages them to teach, not just entertain. With stories like the “magic wand” blind spot and his red-to-purple team analogy, Neta explains how illusions translate into enterprise strategy. For him, certainty is the ultimate illusion, and breaking assumptions creates presence.

			<title><![CDATA[AI & the Fifth Domain of Warfare: A Talk with Eyal Balicer, Cybersecurity Innovator & Thought Leader]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>By Michael Matias, CEO of Clarity and Forbes 30 Under 30 alumCybersecurity has entered a new domain—literally. As Eyal Balicer put it in our recent conversation: “Cyberspace is now the fifth domain of warfare.” But in this domain, the battleground isn’t just code. It’s control.Eyal brings a rare vantage point to the AI-cyber nexus—he’s held senior cybersecurity roles in the Israeli government, Fortune 100 companies like Citi, and top-tier venture capital. Our discussion centered on a growing truth: with the rise of agentic systems—AI entities that can act, decide, and evolve—the mission of cybersecurity is changing.“We are shifting from a world where intelligence was a scarce resource to one where that is not necessarily the case; true agency is becoming the new elusive driver of prosperity and growth,” Eyal explained. “The systems we are now securing are not just automated—they are autonomous, highly competent, and opaque.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;By Michael Matias, CEO of Clarity and Forbes 30 Under 30 alumCybersecurity has entered a new domain—literally. As Eyal Balicer put it in our recent conversation: “Cyberspace is now the fifth domain of warfare.” But in this domain, the battleground isn’t just code. It’s control.Eyal brings a rare vantage point to the AI-cyber nexus—he’s held senior cybersecurity roles in the Israeli government, Fortune 100 companies like Citi, and top-tier venture capital. Our discussion centered on a growing truth: with the rise of agentic systems—AI entities that can act, decide, and evolve—the mission of cybersecurity is changing.“We are shifting from a world where intelligence was a scarce resource to one where that is not necessarily the case; true agency is becoming the new elusive driver of prosperity and growth,” Eyal explained. “The systems we are now securing are not just automated—they are autonomous, highly competent, and opaque. Traditional defenses cannot keep up.”It’s a shift I’ve seen firsthand at Clarity, where we build proactive defenses against deepfakes and AI-generated phishing. Just like Shahar Peled told me about agentic AI revolutionizing offensive testing, Eyal sees these agents redefining global threat models. The challenge isn’t identifying known threats—it’s safeguarding systems that learn, adapt, and act independently.And that requires a new security architecture.“An AI agent can have fluid permissions, context-based roles, and evolving identity,” he told me. “Conventional IAM just does not cut it anymore.” In that sense, Balicer echoes voices like Ron Nissim and Alon Jackson, who both called for a redefinition of identity management in the AI age.But Eyal&amp;#39;s view goes broader: geopolitical.

			<title><![CDATA[Cybersecurity’s AI Moment: A Conversation with Ron Peled, Founder of Sola]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>By Michael Matias, CEO of Clarity and Forbes 30 Under 30 alumWe’re not easing into the AI era—we’ve been thrown into it. That’s how Ron Peled, founder of Sola and former CISO at LivePerson, described the current moment: “The Big Bang already happened. Now we’re just trying to contain the blast.”Ron’s clarity around AI’s impact on cybersecurity is jarring—and refreshing. He doesn’t talk about threat vectors or dashboards. He talks about control. About complexity. About what breaks when the world adopts generative AI faster than the security stack can respond.Like many of the leaders I’ve spoken with—Dorit Dor at Check Point, Tsion Gonen at Protego, Elik Etzion at Elron—Ron sees AI as both threat and tool. But what makes his voice unique is his insistence on simplicity. “The era of bloated, ‘luxury’ cybersecurity products is over,” he said. “What teams need now is focus. Precision. Clean UX. Solutions that don’t overwhelm—just work.”That perspective echoes something Tom Mes told me about CISOs today: they don’t have the luxury of managing theoretical risk. Their job is to enable the business without drowning in alerts or friction. In that sense, Sola’s approach reflects a growing pattern—cybersecurity as a minimalist, embedded experience.But Ron takes it further. He doesn’t just want cleaner tools. He wants community-based security. “Everyone talks about shared defense,” he said. “Almost no one builds for it.” He sees this as the next evolution—not more tech, but more collective action. A model that looks more like a neighborhood watch and less like a gated compound.It’s a mindset I’ve come to share at Clarity. Whether we’re tackling deepfakes or phishing automation, the organizations moving fastest are the ones who build for people, not just systems. The ones who remember that cybersecurity is, at its core, a coordination challenge.Ron also spoke to the evolving role of the CISO. No longer just a gatekeeper, the modern security leader needs to be what he calls “a productively paranoid operator”—someone who sees what’s coming and builds guardrails without becoming the roadblock.That term stuck with me: productively paranoid.Because that’s exactly what AI requires. The attacks are faster. The tools are more accessible. And the stakes—for privacy, for resilience, for trust—have never been higher.As our conversation wrapped, Ron returned to the urgency. “Organizations don’t want partial solutions,” he said. “They want defenses that move at the speed of the threats.”In that sense, the mission is simple: Build security tools that scale with AI, not lag behind it. Architect for clarity, not complexity. And never forget—the Big Bang already happened.The question now is: who’s ready to build the shield?About Michael Matias:Michael Matias is the CEO and Co-Founder of Clarity, an AI-powered cybersecurity startup backed by venture capital firms including Bessemer Venture Partners and Walden Catalyst. Clarity develops advanced AI technologies protecting organizations from sophisticated phishing attacks and AI-generated social engineering threats, including deepfakes. Before founding Clarity, Matias studied Computer Science with a specialization in AI at Stanford University and led cybersecurity teams in Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces.

			<title><![CDATA[AI and the End of Alert Fatigue: A Conversation with Tsion (TJ) Gonen, Cybersecurity Expert]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>By Michael Matias, CEO of Clarity and Forbes 30 Under 30 alum</p><p>For decades, cybersecurity vendors have armed defenders with dashboards filled with red alerts. But they rarely delivered solutions. As Tsion (TJ) Gonen put it in our recent conversation: “97% of tools just showed you a red screen that said, basically, ‘you suck.’” No remediation. No action. Just fatigue.That paradigm is ending—and AI is the catalyst.Gonen, a veteran cybersecurity leader and founder of Protego Labs (acquired by Check Point), has spent three decades watching the industry wrestle with inefficiency. Today, he sees a profound shift. “Security teams don’t want more tools,” he told me. “They want outcomes. They want closed loops.”This point echoes what Dorit Dor, CTO of Check Point, told me: AI isn’t just another layer of detection. It must act—autonomously and in real-time. At Clarity, we see this daily as we intercept deepfakes and AI-generated phishing attacks that move too fast for human intervention.But before the shift to AI, Gonen argues, the security industry was already in trouble. Too much noise. Not enough signal. “Cybersecurity reached a tipping point even before AI,” he said. “People began to question if the whole model was working.”AI, he believes, doesn’t just enhance existing tools—it reshapes the game.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;By Michael Matias, CEO of Clarity and Forbes 30 Under 30 alum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, cybersecurity vendors have armed defenders with dashboards filled with red alerts. But they rarely delivered solutions. As Tsion (TJ) Gonen put it in our recent conversation: “97% of tools just showed you a red screen that said, basically, ‘you suck.’” No remediation. No action. Just fatigue.That paradigm is ending—and AI is the catalyst.Gonen, a veteran cybersecurity leader and founder of Protego Labs (acquired by Check Point), has spent three decades watching the industry wrestle with inefficiency. Today, he sees a profound shift. “Security teams don’t want more tools,” he told me. “They want outcomes. They want closed loops.”This point echoes what Dorit Dor, CTO of Check Point, told me: AI isn’t just another layer of detection. It must act—autonomously and in real-time. At Clarity, we see this daily as we intercept deepfakes and AI-generated phishing attacks that move too fast for human intervention.But before the shift to AI, Gonen argues, the security industry was already in trouble. Too much noise. Not enough signal. “Cybersecurity reached a tipping point even before AI,” he said. “People began to question if the whole model was working.”AI, he believes, doesn’t just enhance existing tools—it reshapes the game. From reducing product development costs to enabling automated response, AI democratizes defense the same way it democratized attack. “The ability to close loops automatically is what makes AI transformational,” he said.It’s a point that also came up in my conversation with Shahar Peled of Terra Security. Shahar talked about replacing manual pentesting with agentic AI. Gonen’s vision is broader: don’t just find issues—resolve them, immediately and autonomously.Yet many founders, he warns, still fall into the same trap: mistaking incremental tech improvements for true breakthroughs. “Real differentiation isn’t just in the tech,” Gonen said. “It’s in how well you integrate into operational workflows.”This distinction—between technology and execution—reminds me of what Tsion (TJ) shares with leaders like Tom Mes: the CISO’s job has become impossibly complex.

She explains how today’s scale, personalization, and ease of manipulation fuel “reality apathy,” empowering leaders to dismiss inconvenient truths as “AI.” Beyond any single tool, she argues for equitable standards, privacy‑aware provenance, usable detection, and media literacy that fits real newsroom and fact‑checking workflows—especially outside well‑resourced markets.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>With decades in cybersecurity, Benjamin Corll has seen threat landscapes evolve from simple antivirus battles to AI-driven social engineering. For Corll, every breach traces back to people—both as the strongest defense and the weakest link. In this conversation, he unpacks the persistence of ransomware and business email compromise, the rise of AI-assisted fraud, and why criminals increasingly “log in” instead of “hack in.” He explains why defense in depth must integrate technology with human training, process checkpoints, and zero trust principles. Most importantly, Corll shares how to make awareness programs relevant, engaging, and role-specific—turning employees into active sensors who strengthen security culture from within.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>From disappearing people in videos in the late 1990s to shaping AI and vision systems at Intel, Tal Hassner, Chief Scientist for Computer Vision, has watched synthetic media evolve from lab curiosities to global challenges. In this conversation, he dismantles the idea that “is it fake?” is the central question for security. Instead, he lays out a three-pillar approach—provenance, attribution, and integrity—that can outlast the arms race between deepfake creators and detectors. Drawing on decades of research and product experience, Hassner explains why harmful content remains harmful regardless of its origin, and why enterprises must shift from chasing fakes to building trust into their systems from the ground up.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>From phishing tests to AI-driven impersonation scams, Joshua Scarpino has seen firsthand how the human element remains the most critical factor in cybersecurity. Drawing on his experience across organizations from NIST to Trust Engine, he explains why technology alone can’t safeguard an enterprise. Instead, effective defense comes from a culture where security is personal—linked to daily habits and values employees carry beyond the workplace. With threats evolving faster than traditional training can adapt, Scarpino shares how bite-sized, relevant, and personalized awareness programs not only reduce risk but transform how teams think, act, and protect.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ilke Demir’s journey from computational geometry to combating deepfakes began with a question: what makes something truly human? At Intel’s Trusted Media team, she developed FakeCatcher, a tool that detects deepfakes using biological signals like heart rate. In this episode, she unpacks the technical, ethical, and social layers of media trust, explaining why provenance and human perception matter as much as detection. Her insights reveal how defending truth in the AI age isn’t just about better algorithms—it’s about understanding people.</p>

			<title><![CDATA["AI Creates New Threats, but Also Unlocks Solutions We Never Had Before.", a Talk With Maor Saubron]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In a world where cybersecurity threats evolve faster than our defenses, AI-driven risks are becoming the frontline challenge for enterprises. To gain deeper insights into this rapidly shifting landscape, I spoke with Maor Saubron, Head of Corporate Security at Amdocs, whose decades-long journey through cybersecurity offers an unparalleled view into how organizations can effectively respond to emerging threats.Maor leads a team of over 200 security professionals at Amdocs, a global technology giant serving critical infrastructure for telecom companies like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. His role places him at the intersection of security innovation and practical implementation, uniquely qualifying him to discuss AI’s growing impact on cybersecurity strategies.&quot;We are in a technological race against our attackers,&quot; Maor emphasized during our conversation. &quot;AI is significantly reshaping the landscape by not just creating advanced threats but also by providing revolutionary solutions.&quot;One key insight from Maor was the dual nature of AI—it is both an enabler of sophisticated cyber threats and a powerful tool for defense. At Amdocs, Maor described facing enormous cybersecurity challenges due to the vast scale of their operations: hundreds of thousands of servers globally, over tens of thousands of endpoints, and approximately 30,000 employees in 90 countries. With this scale, managing the risk is both complex and critical.&quot;We receive tens of millions of emails per month, and a significant portion of these are spam or phishing,&quot; Maor revealed. The sheer volume demonstrates why traditional cybersecurity methods are inadequate. To tackle such massive challenges, Maor’s team deploys multiple layers of protection and leverages AI-powered tools to analyze patterns and reduce response times dramatically.However, despite the advanced technological frameworks, Maor pointed out a pivotal vulnerability that technology alone can&#39;t solve—the human factor. &quot;At the end of the day, cybersecurity incidents often start with a single employee,&quot; he noted. &quot;Our mission is to foster a deep security culture among employees, making them part of our defense strategy.&quot;This cultural shift includes comprehensive awareness programs, highly sophisticated phishing simulations, and personalized training that empower employees to recognize and respond effectively to threats. Maor believes cybersecurity must transcend technical solutions, incorporating an organization&#39;s entire human element into a holistic security strategy.When we discussed emerging threats, Maor highlighted how generative AI tools like ChatGPT have introduced new risks, especially around data leakage. Employees frequently use these tools, unintentionally exposing sensitive corporate information. Amdocs responded proactively by establishing an AI governance committee, implementing sophisticated monitoring tools, and introducing educational initiatives about responsible AI use. Maor explained, &quot;We give employees freedom but maintain control through intelligent, automated oversight.&quot;I found Maor&#39;s approach insightful and reflective of an essential evolution in cybersecurity thinking: the integration of technological innovation with strategic human-centric policies. As organizations continue to navigate this complex environment, understanding and proactively managing both AI-driven threats and human vulnerabilities will define future cybersecurity successes.Reflecting on my conversation with Maor, it&#39;s clear that successful cybersecurity strategies must prioritize adaptability and human engagement. Companies that empower their teams through awareness, training, and AI-driven support will build resilient defenses capable of handling tomorrow&#39;s threats.The path forward requires a thoughtful blend of AI technology and a deep investment in human-centric cybersecurity cultures. This balanced approach, championed by security leaders like Maor, is not just beneficial—it is imperative.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Passwordless Security in the Age of AI: A Conversation with Slavik Markovich, CEO of Descope]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Cybersecurity is once again at a critical crossroads—this time, driven by the explosive growth of AI technologies. During a recent visit to Descope’s Palo Alto office, I sat down with CEO Slavik Markovich, a veteran in the cybersecurity space whose past ventures, Demisto (acquired by Palo Alto Networks) and Sentrigo (acquired by McAfee), shaped much of the modern security landscape. Our conversation centered around how AI is radically reshaping digital identity.</p><p><br /></p><p>Slavik and his team—collaborators for nearly three decades—launched Descope with a bold mission: eliminate passwords altogether. “Passwords are the worst of both worlds,” he noted, “hard for humans to remember and easy for computers to crack.” As AI supercharges phishing and other attack vectors, traditional passwords only grow more inadequate.</p><p><br /></p><p>Instead, Slavik advocates for passkeys—phishing-resistant, cryptographic keys stored locally and authenticated via biometrics, without ever exposing the biometric data. It's a fundamentally more secure and seamless approach to authentication.</p><p><br /></p><p>Descope’s innovation doesn’t stop there. As AI evolves into “agentic” form—digital agents acting on behalf of users—the company is tackling a new security frontier. These agents don’t fit neatly into existing models of user authentication or machine-to-machine trust. “The industry is shifting toward agentic AI,” Slavik explained, “and that’s expanding the scale and complexity of identity management.”</p><p><br /></p><p>One surprisingly common challenge they’re solving is the "confused agent problem," where digital agents unintentionally act with higher privileges than intended. Descope positions itself as the intermediary—managing progressive authorization, mediating between users, agents, and applications, and ensuring secure, compliant interactions.</p><p><br /></p><p>For CISOs and enterprise leaders, this shift presents both urgency and opportunity. AI is no longer an emerging edge case—it’s embedded in tools and workflows across organizations. Security teams must act swiftly to secure agent-driven interactions and identity touchpoints or risk falling behind.</p><p><br /></p><p>At Clarity, where I focus on AI-powered threats like deepfakes and next-gen phishing, I see firsthand how vital identity management has become. It’s no longer just a login issue—it’s the first and most critical line of defense. Security solutions must be both robust and frictionless, balancing user experience with airtight protection.</p><p><br /></p><p>Slavik also shared a personal insight that stood out to me: “We prioritize having fun. We’ve built multiple companies together because we genuinely enjoy the journey.” That mindset resonates. The best cybersecurity innovations come from passionate teams that love solving hard problems, not just building defenses.</p><p><br /></p><p>The identity revolution is already underway. Organizations that embrace passwordless, agent-aware authentication now will dramatically improve both their security and user experience. Those that delay will face rising vulnerabilities and growing user frustration.</p><p><br /></p><p>Our industry isn’t just evolving—it’s undergoing a full-scale transformation. Proactively embracing agentic AI, passkeys, and adaptive identity strategies is not just smart—it’s essential. Those who lead will define the future of digital trust. Those who don’t may find themselves struggling to catch up in a threat landscape redefined by AI.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is once again at a critical crossroads—this time, driven by the explosive growth of AI technologies. During a recent visit to Descope’s Palo Alto office, I sat down with CEO Slavik Markovich, a veteran in the cybersecurity space whose past ventures, Demisto (acquired by Palo Alto Networks) and Sentrigo (acquired by McAfee), shaped much of the modern security landscape. Our conversation centered around how AI is radically reshaping digital identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slavik and his team—collaborators for nearly three decades—launched Descope with a bold mission: eliminate passwords altogether. “Passwords are the worst of both worlds,” he noted, “hard for humans to remember and easy for computers to crack.” As AI supercharges phishing and other attack vectors, traditional passwords only grow more inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Slavik advocates for passkeys—phishing-resistant, cryptographic keys stored locally and authenticated via biometrics, without ever exposing the biometric data. It&apos;s a fundamentally more secure and seamless approach to authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descope’s innovation doesn’t stop there. As AI evolves into “agentic” form—digital agents acting on behalf of users—the company is tackling a new security frontier. These agents don’t fit neatly into existing models of user authentication or machine-to-machine trust. “The industry is shifting toward agentic AI,” Slavik explained, “and that’s expanding the scale and complexity of identity management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surprisingly common challenge they’re solving is the &quot;confused agent problem,&quot; where digital agents unintentionally act with higher privileges than intended. Descope positions itself as the intermediary—managing progressive authorization, mediating between users, agents, and applications, and ensuring secure, compliant interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CISOs and enterprise leaders, this shift presents both urgency and opportunity. AI is no longer an emerging edge case—it’s embedded in tools and workflows across organizations. Security teams must act swiftly to secure agent-driven interactions and identity touchpoints or risk falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Clarity, where I focus on AI-powered threats like deepfakes and next-gen phishing, I see firsthand how vital identity management has become. It’s no longer just a login issue—it’s the first and most critical line of defense. Security solutions must be both robust and frictionless, balancing user experience with airtight protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slavik also shared a personal insight that stood out to me: “We prioritize having fun. We’ve built multiple companies together because we genuinely enjoy the journey.” That mindset resonates. The best cybersecurity innovations come from passionate teams that love solving hard problems, not just building defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The identity revolution is already underway. Organizations that embrace passwordless, agent-aware authentication now will dramatically improve both their security and user experience. Those that delay will face rising vulnerabilities and growing user frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our industry isn’t just evolving—it’s undergoing a full-scale transformation. Proactively embracing agentic AI, passkeys, and adaptive identity strategies is not just smart—it’s essential. Those who lead will define the future of digital trust. Those who don’t may find themselves struggling to catch up in a threat landscape redefined by AI.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[AI’s New Frontier in Data Security: A Conversation with Flow Security CEO Jonathan Roizin]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Michael Matias, CEO of Clarity and Forbes 30 Under 30 alum</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Cybersecurity is at a turning point, driven by artificial intelligence (AI). My conversation with Jonathan Roizin, CEO of Flow Security—now part of CrowdStrike—reinforced the urgent need for organizations to rethink data protection strategies in an era of dynamic, fluid information exchange.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>The Shifting Nature of Data Security</strong><br />Roizin, a veteran of elite Israeli cybersecurity organizations, has spent over 15 years tackling cyber threats. His focus on "data in motion" highlights a critical reality: data no longer sits in static environments. It moves continuously across cloud services, SaaS platforms, and APIs, fundamentally altering security needs.</p><p><br /></p><p>The stakes are enormous. IBM’s 2023 Cost of a Data Breach report revealed that the average breach now costs $4.45 million. Meanwhile, organizations use over 130 SaaS applications, a number increasing nearly 18% annually. Yet, many still rely on outdated security models that assume clear perimeters around data.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>The Decline of Traditional Defenses</strong><br />Roizin emphasized the need to move beyond legacy Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) strategies, which were designed for endpoint security and internal networks. “The boundaries have been broken,” he explained. As organizations migrate to cloud environments like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, perimeter-based security models are becoming ineffective. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 85% of businesses will operate primarily in the cloud.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>AI as a Threat and a Defense Mechanism</strong><br />The rise of AI compounds security challenges.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Michael Matias, CEO of Clarity and Forbes 30 Under 30 alum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is at a turning point, driven by artificial intelligence (AI). My conversation with Jonathan Roizin, CEO of Flow Security—now part of CrowdStrike—reinforced the urgent need for organizations to rethink data protection strategies in an era of dynamic, fluid information exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Shifting Nature of Data Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roizin, a veteran of elite Israeli cybersecurity organizations, has spent over 15 years tackling cyber threats. His focus on &quot;data in motion&quot; highlights a critical reality: data no longer sits in static environments. It moves continuously across cloud services, SaaS platforms, and APIs, fundamentally altering security needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes are enormous. IBM’s 2023 Cost of a Data Breach report revealed that the average breach now costs $4.45 million. Meanwhile, organizations use over 130 SaaS applications, a number increasing nearly 18% annually. Yet, many still rely on outdated security models that assume clear perimeters around data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Decline of Traditional Defenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roizin emphasized the need to move beyond legacy Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) strategies, which were designed for endpoint security and internal networks. “The boundaries have been broken,” he explained. As organizations migrate to cloud environments like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, perimeter-based security models are becoming ineffective. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 85% of businesses will operate primarily in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI as a Threat and a Defense Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rise of AI compounds security challenges. AI-powered tools—such as coding assistants and automated meeting note-takers—introduce new vulnerabilities. Employees often share sensitive information through unmonitored AI platforms, inadvertently exposing critical data. A Team8 report found AI-driven phishing attacks have surged by more than 2,000%, with nearly half using GPT-generated communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, AI also strengthens cybersecurity. Flow Security leverages AI-driven automation to classify and monitor sensitive data in real time, providing dynamic protection that traditional security models cannot achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Urgent Need for Proactive AI Integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The future of cybersecurity demands a philosophical shift—security cannot rely on passive visibility. Instead, AI-driven real-time interventions must become the norm.

			<title><![CDATA[How AI is Shaping the Future of Cyber: A Conversation with Liran Grinberg, Co-founder of Team8]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Cybersecurity today is more dynamic and critical than ever, thanks to the transformative influence of AI. Liran Grinberg, Co-founder of Team8, highlighted this evolution in a recent discussion. Drawing on his experience from Israel's elite Unit 8200 and managing over $1 billion in ventures, he shed light on how AI is reshaping cybersecurity. He emphasized that AI isn't just enhancing existing technologies but enabling previously impossible capabilities, which also broadens the attack surface—creating both new vulnerabilities and opportunities for innovation.Grinberg's perspective resonated with my own observations at Clarity, where AI has expanded the threat landscape while revolutionizing defense capabilities. Traditional reactive models are becoming outdated. Analysts are now evolving into supervisors of AI-driven agents managing operational tasks, which showcases how AI integration can bolster cybersecurity effectiveness. This shift is essential, particularly given the increasing complexity and sophistication of threats, such as AI-driven phishing and deepfakes.Speed and momentum are critical in the competitive world of cybersecurity. Grinberg pointed out the necessity for rapid, responsible decision-making to secure market leadership. This aligns with Clarity's approach, where staying ahead of threats is not optional but a mandate for survival. He also emphasized the enduring need for domain expertise, particularly when integrating complex AI solutions into cybersecurity strategies. Without such expertise, even the most advanced tools risk being ineffective.Grinberg's outlook underscores the need for proactive, predictive, and preventive strategies in cybersecurity. At Team8, their AI Excellence Center exemplifies this by focusing on deep, strategic AI integration rather than surface-level adoption. The accelerated adoption of AI presents unmatched opportunities but also escalates risks for those lagging behind.The message is clear: embracing AI-driven cybersecurity is no longer optional. Organizations must prioritize strategic AI integration to ensure resilience and efficiency in an increasingly complex threat environment. As Grinberg said, the future of cybersecurity is dynamic, proactive, and deeply intelligent. Those who delay risk falling dangerously behind.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity today is more dynamic and critical than ever, thanks to the transformative influence of AI. Liran Grinberg, Co-founder of Team8, highlighted this evolution in a recent discussion. Drawing on his experience from Israel&apos;s elite Unit 8200 and managing over $1 billion in ventures, he shed light on how AI is reshaping cybersecurity. He emphasized that AI isn&apos;t just enhancing existing technologies but enabling previously impossible capabilities, which also broadens the attack surface—creating both new vulnerabilities and opportunities for innovation.Grinberg&apos;s perspective resonated with my own observations at Clarity, where AI has expanded the threat landscape while revolutionizing defense capabilities. Traditional reactive models are becoming outdated. Analysts are now evolving into supervisors of AI-driven agents managing operational tasks, which showcases how AI integration can bolster cybersecurity effectiveness. This shift is essential, particularly given the increasing complexity and sophistication of threats, such as AI-driven phishing and deepfakes.Speed and momentum are critical in the competitive world of cybersecurity. Grinberg pointed out the necessity for rapid, responsible decision-making to secure market leadership. This aligns with Clarity&apos;s approach, where staying ahead of threats is not optional but a mandate for survival. He also emphasized the enduring need for domain expertise, particularly when integrating complex AI solutions into cybersecurity strategies. Without such expertise, even the most advanced tools risk being ineffective.Grinberg&apos;s outlook underscores the need for proactive, predictive, and preventive strategies in cybersecurity. At Team8, their AI Excellence Center exemplifies this by focusing on deep, strategic AI integration rather than surface-level adoption. The accelerated adoption of AI presents unmatched opportunities but also escalates risks for those lagging behind.The message is clear: embracing AI-driven cybersecurity is no longer optional. Organizations must prioritize strategic AI integration to ensure resilience and efficiency in an increasingly complex threat environment. As Grinberg said, the future of cybersecurity is dynamic, proactive, and deeply intelligent. Those who delay risk falling dangerously behind.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Securing the AI Wild West: A Conversation with Elad Schulman, CEO of Lasso]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The arrival of Generative AI marks perhaps the fastest and most dramatic technological change we&#39;ve ever experienced, reshaping cybersecurity at a pace most organizations are unprepared for. A recent conversation with Elad Schulman, CEO and Co-Founder of Lasso, reinforced my understanding that organizations must rapidly adapt to this new reality, where threats evolve continuously and at an unprecedented rate.Schulman, a seasoned entrepreneur who founded and sold the cybersecurity company Segasec to Mimecast, emphasized that upon entering the Generative AI world about two years ago, it felt like stepping into a &quot;new Wild West.&quot; &quot;You need a new sheriff to catch the bad guys,&quot; he noted. This metaphor aptly captures the significant challenge organizations face today as traditional security models, built on static defenses and rigid tools, can no longer handle the dynamic, AI-driven threats.What&#39;s particularly striking about this transformation is the aggressive adoption of AI tools by employees themselves, without waiting for formal approvals or clear organizational policies. As Schulman explained, &quot;Employees didn&#39;t wait for policy or enforcement; they simply started using these tools because they are extraordinarily effective.&quot; Such rapid, unsupervised adoption poses significant security challenges, from sensitive data leaks to exposure to new risks previously nonexistent.Lasso’s approach, under Schulman&#39;s leadership, focuses on providing organizations with comprehensive visibility into employees&#39; use of AI tools. Instead of attempting to block the technology, their strategy enables safe and efficient AI adoption. &quot;Security shouldn&#39;t prevent usage but enable it,&quot; Schulman emphasized. &quot;We must help employees elegantly recover from mistakes rather than just block them.&quot;This approach represents a substantial shift from traditional security methods, which typically create user friction, harm productivity, and ultimately lead employees to circumvent policies. Organizations restricting AI usage risk undermining their competitive edge. Conversely, adopting this technology without adequate security exposes them to significant new vulnerabilities.Beyond security challenges, AI also opens new defensive opportunities. At Lasso, AI is employed to provide organizations immediate and active visibility into internal data flows, quickly identify threats, and neutralize them. &quot;We are not just creating another security tool but an entire platform enabling organizations to adopt AI safely,&quot; Schulman said.From my perspective, we stand at a critical juncture. AI adoption is no longer optional—it’s already here, fundamentally changing the nature of work and security. Organizations strategically integrating AI within their security frameworks will secure a considerable competitive advantage. Those hesitant to do so will find themselves increasingly vulnerable to attacks leveraging precisely these technologies.As Schulman candidly summarized, &quot;We are still learning as we go. Ignoring these changes simply isn&#39;t an option. The technology evolves nearly every week.&quot; In my view, this agile, adaptive, and proactive approach is precisely what cybersecurity leaders must adopt immediately.About Michael MatiasMichael Matias is the CEO and Co-Founder of Clarity, an AI-powered cybersecurity startup backed by venture capital firms including Bessemer Venture Partners and Walden Catalyst.

			<title><![CDATA[AI Revolution in Browser Security: Insights from Ofer Ben-Noon, CTO of SASE at Palo Alto Networks]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p></p><p><strong>By Michael Matias, CEO of Clarity and Forbes 30 Under 30 alum</strong></p><p>Cybersecurity is at a pivotal crossroads, transformed by AI and the realities of hybrid work.

After leading creative operations to protect the state&#39;s infrastructure, they decided to develop a platform that will solve what they define as the next challenge for big companies: identity-based threats to the company&#39;s systems.Rezonate, an identity-centric security platform, locates sophisticated unusual behaviors within an organization&#39;s systems, among customers, employees, etc.—and presents the organization with a sort of storyline view of where the treatment of each problem stands.Roy, the CEO of Rezonate, will talk about the next challenges in the field of cloud security and his passionate career path.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jasmine Bharucha is the Founder and CEO of Katharos foods, a brand that crafts clean and healthy plant-based cheese. At the helm of the company, she spearheads all the growth-driven and business-critical decisions while charting the product roadmap. </p>
<p>Having an MBA from Northeastern University, Boston, USA, Jasmine holds over 17 years of work experience with the leading multinational companies KPMG and Capgemini. A few years back, she started her journey to lead a healthy plant based lifestyle and observed the lack of good quality and affordable vegan cheese in the market. This motivated her to bring plant-based dairy alternatives for people who want high-nutrition and affordable plant based lifestyles with Katharos. After spending years in the corporate world, she started her entrepreneurial journey with Katharos in 2019. Since its inception, the company providing an assortment of 100% natural cheese has garnered its foothold in the market. Awarded for her efforts, Jasmine was selected among the top 5 Humane Entrepreneurs in India by HSI in 2020. Under her leadership, Katharos was named the ‘Best Vegan Cheese in India’ by PETA in 2021. </p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ep963: Chris Clews | Author, What 80s Pop Culture Teaches Us About Life and Work]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Growing up in the '80s and with over twenty years of leadership experience in corporate marketing, Chris Clews knew three things very well – '80s pop culture, business and this crazy thing we call life. One day, in his mid 40s, he was on his couch having a self pity party of one over a job that just wasn’t working out for him. Flipping channels he stopped on the classic 1983 movie The Outsiders and literally jumped off his couch when he heard Johnny Cade say, “You still have a lot of time to make yourself be what you want.” Yes I do still have a lot of time to make myself be what I want, he thought to himself. He left his corporate career of 20 plus years and combined his areas of expertise to create the popular book series, The Ultimate Series on Essential Work &amp; Life Lessons from ‘80s Pop Culture, which includes two volumes of What '80s Pop Culture Teaches Us About Today’s Workplace, with a third title scheduled to be released late September 2022, Raised on The '80s: 30+ Unexpected Life Lessons from the Movies and Music That Defined Pop Culture’s Most Excellent Decade. He parlayed the books into a keynote speaking career on the same topic.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Aayush is the CEO and Founder of OpsLyft. Before OpsLyft, Aayush worked as a Lead DevOps Engineer at Indix. There he was given the responsibility to handle the whole cloud infrastructure which had a budget of upwards of $5 million. This rigorous exercise made him realize the fundamental problems with cloud cost optimization and how it is an ongoing exercise. When Aayush researched the market of cloud management platforms, he found out that even though there are a plethora of cloud solutions existing, most of them were just focused on providing analytics or just using “best practices” to provide short-term solutions. This made him pivot from being a developer to an entrepreneur and he started OpsLyft with the goal to help organizations manage their cloud operations the right way.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>During his career working in the high-tech corporate world, Jeff Shardell learned that the deodorant he used daily was filled with harmful chemicals linked to cancer, Alzheimer&apos;s disease, and other illnesses. He realized his body was likely absorbing these nasty chemicals and decided something had to change. Jeff wanted to see if he could make a truly natural deodorant that actually worked, with as few ingredients as possible. After extensive research and a lot of trial and error in his San Francisco kitchen, Jeff stumbled onto a magic formula. Just 4 clean and simple ingredients would change the world of all-natural deodorants for good. Not only was Jeff&apos;s formula made from ingredients found in his own kitchen, but it was more effective at naturally beating odors than anything else out there.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Before starting Deeb, Nir was a project manager for several startups, then later decided to transition into Business Development roles. He was humbled to get the opportunity to work at Pearl-Cohen Law Firm as an Investment Banker where he launched an initiative to make better connections between startups and investors. A year ago, Nir was reminded of an old idea he had, that started out as a small initiative in the field of employment, that later grew and evolved into Deeb: the idea to fundamentally change the way employment is perceived, and the way people think about employment in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Ep627: Mark Babbitt | President, WordIQ, Co-Author, Good Comes First]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Employees of all generations desire—and deserve—workplaces where they feel respected and are validated for their ideas, efforts, and contributions, every day. As we&apos;re witnessing right now, when a company culture falls short of those expectations, top talent is cutting the lifeline that has tethered them to their old employers and old, autocratic leaders (often afflicted with what we call Boomer Male Syndrome or BMS). In record numbers, good people are leaving bad companies—or at least bad company cultures. To retain and attract top talent, today&apos;s leaders must now work with all stakeholders (not just shareholders) to co-create an uncompromising company culture where employees can expect respect while helping drive results. In other words, they must ensure good comes first. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For decades, talented people have tolerated old-school leaders who put results before respect, toxic company cultures, and workplaces that suck. But those days are over, and if leaders want to attract and retain the best employees—while improving productivity, customer service, employee satisfaction, and profits—it’s time for them to create work cultures where good comes first.<br/><br/>The problem is that because the corporate world has too often been driven primarily by results, we seldom ask leaders to change their work cultures. Even if we did, most leaders don’t have the know-how. This book provides the actionable inspiration and practical direction needed to make that change happen.<br/><br/>In Good Comes First, Chris and his co-author Mark S. Babbitt present proven strategies that help senior leaders define, align, and refine a purposeful, positive, and productive work cultures - cultures where good comes first for employees, customers, leaders, and stakeholders—and where improved business outcomes quickly follow.&quot;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>After building and managing teams in different places in the IDF Intelligence Corps, I was head of the hardcore R&amp;D section at 8200. I then took a giant risk and built a new SaaS product for Intsights, hoping I’d quickly adapt to the modern tech stack and it turned out to be very successful. I started anecdotes with two friends, Roi and Eitan, and we currently have 30 employees in Tel Aviv. Transforming from R&amp;D Manager to CEO means managing Marketing and Sales, which is another big move. But it seems like it’s working so far because modern R&amp;D and modern M&amp;S departments actually are very similar.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ep422: Paul Bilodeau | CEO and Founder, Filtered.AI]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Bilodeau is the CEO and founder of Filtered, a capabilities-based hiring platform designed specifically for engineers, developers, and tech talent, that helps to remove unconscious bias from the hiring process through assessments and coding tasks. Paul started his professional career as a recruiter for a leading recruitment firm in Boston. It wasn’t long before he identified major disconnects and inefficiencies when it came to the hiring process, so in 2010 he created PangeaConnect, a video interviewing platform. Soon after, he co-founded a data science consulting company refactorED, and built Filtered as an internal tool to ensure candidate authentication and more accurately assess candidates’ technical skills. In 2018, the demand to license Filtered as a standalone product led to the establishment of Filtered, Inc. and the continued drive to radically change the hiring process.</p>

Returning to Israel (2012), I decided to establish a company that will focus on making Motorsport more accessible and affordable, using new technologies and solutions yet to be implemented in the industry. We started by addressing the needs of the driver and developed the G1- a race car that combines extreme performance with affordability, but our true success was uncovering the larger opportunity for smart-connected racecars and a comprehensive data solution for the racing and automotive industries.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Francis leads a team of 300 people and has raised $6M in capital to build Invisible, a disruptive work-automation company that provides custom operations support to scaling businesses. Previously, Francis raised $2.6M from top investors to build Everest, a social network based on “what you do” not “who you know.” He worked briefly in consulting and at Google after studying history at Cornell. People who’ve worked with Francis say his strategy comes from “clear, deep thinking,” that he excels at “building models, communicating vision, and motivating his team.” Most importantly he’s refreshingly honest about success, failures, and his learnings along the way.
